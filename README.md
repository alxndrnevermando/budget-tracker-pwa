  ## Description
 This applications boasts PWA functionality, alllowing it (in theory) to work offline in a native app that users can store on their desktop or home sreen on their phones. Currently, I was unable to determine why the function does not work after more than one transaction is entered in the application. Would like to tackle this in the future.
